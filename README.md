# LEO-Satellite
LEO Satellite 6-DOF Simulation implemented in C++ with project setup/build in C-make

Featuring Attitude Control, Orbit Control/station-keeping, and optimization for RCS thruster usage.

(Currently In Development), (I expect to be finished by the new year) (life got in the way)
  


Development progress log:

  -Nov 13: got controller setup to add and convert quaternions into the comparative MRP for the attitude control law, controller seems all setup
  -Nov 15: 
  -Dec 1: Paused progress on this project since I realized I didn't properly learn Linear Algebra well and opted to read and practice math instead of      this. Will continue progress once I have this sorted out.
